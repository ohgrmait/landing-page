## About

This project shows a "**mario-themed**" landing page which was initially designed to create an entire web page from two design images (as per project specifications) but later on stylized to provide a unique personal touch based on the famous "Super Mario Bros."[^1]

## Self Reflections
- > I really enjoyed recreating the webpage design and then personalizing it via the "**mario-theme**". After my [previous project](https://github.com/ohgrmait/odin-recipes), the only thing that I added to my arsenal was flexbox, which I absolutely loved doing. I might have gone overboard again but it was pleasant experience to add more than what the project specification asked for. TOP resources (especially the articles) in the flexbox section were a big help.
